# POEM 2021 paper modell

poem.cairis is the model corresponding with the worked example in Section 4.

The account poem_reviewer@test.com (password: test) has been created on https://demo.cairis.org, so you can interact with the model without installing CAIRIS. Instructions for importing the model can be found here.

The live demo account and this repository will only exist for the life of the review process. Should the paper be accepted, the paper model will be uploaded to Zenodo, and this repository will be removed.
